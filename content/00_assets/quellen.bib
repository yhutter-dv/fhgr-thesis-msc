    abstract = {In this article we propose a methodology helping RATP (public transport operator) experts to analyze railway big amount of data. Indeed, a huge number of data can rapidly lead to focus on wrong analysis. We developed a tool prototype based on visual analytics process that can display an overview of a selected railway network area. This overview deals with one or several operating days of the same railway line. The operator chooses statistical indicators to obtain a suitable view display for his specific study. This process is the first part of our work which will model the human driver pattern using machine learning and data mining. Our work methodology is based on Visual analytics process.}

abstract = {The large vehicle movement traffic datasets offer a lot of great opportunities for the evolution of new methodologies for the analysis of the transportation system. However, deriving relevant traffic patterns from such a vast amount of historical dataset is challenging. In this paper, several data mining techniques have been applied to obtain more understanding about urban traffic patterns by analyzing hourly and daily variation in urban traffic flow dataset. A model has been developed for the analysis of spatial and temporal patterns in urban traffic data. Model development involves the formulation of algorithms to be applied to the data and choice of various metrics to evaluate the clustering algorithm. Furthermore, these techniques have been applied to the traffic dataset of Aarhus, the second-largest city of Denmark. Finally, results are analyzed to determine the various factors that affect the traffic flow patterns in an urban area.}

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the day-to-day regularity of urban congestion patterns. We first partition link speed data every 10 min into 3D clusters that propose a parsimonious sketch of the congestion pulse. We then gather days with similar patterns and use consensus clustering methods to produce a unique global pattern that fits multiple days, uncovering the day-to-day regularity. We show that the network of Amsterdam over 35 days can be synthesized into only 4 consensual 3D speed maps with 9 clusters. This paves the way for a cutting-edge systematic method for travel time predictions in cities. By matching the current observation to historical consensual 3D speed maps, we design an efficient real-time method that successfully predicts 84{\%} trips travel times with an error margin below 25{\%}. The new concept of consensual 3D speed maps allows us to extract the essence out of large amounts of link speed observations and as a result reveals a global and previously mostly hidden picture of traffic dynamics at the whole city scale, which may be more regular and predictable than expected.},
